Angular Front-End Test
[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/utopia-angular-challenge)

This test introduces a http based search of Rick & Morty characters.
The following will test the use of common apis in Angular
as well as your approach to solving the problems outlined.

Step 1 - Set Up:

Route A:
Press the "Fork" button located at the top left of this page.
This will instantly generate a new url and copy of this test for you to work on.

Save the url it generates, this is where you will demonstrate
the changes you've made.

Next Download the project to your local machine.
To successfully run the project on your machine you will need.

NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/
Angular CLI: https://angular.io/cli
VsCode (or Preffered Editor): https://code.visualstudio.com/

Route B:
If you do not wish to download the project, you can apply changes directly to this page.
just remember to save the url for your demo.

Step 2 - Challenge:

Api: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

1. Refactoring: Angulars strength lies in it's component re-usabality. Refactor the Mat-Card
   into your own component. It must retain the same details.

2. Filter Fix:
   A) When searching with a filter applied the data brought back does not match.
   B) Changing the filter does not bring back results from the server.

3. Order By: Currently there is not a way to order the data brought back.
   Implement a way to order the cards, by the characters first appearance in the show and another of your choosing.

Step 3 - Upload

Once you have made all your changes, you can simply drag and drop your new files here.
