Angular CLI: https://angular.io/cli
VsCode (or Preffered Editor): https://code.visualstudio.com/

Step 2 - Problem solving:

Api: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

1. Refactoring: Angulars strength lies in it's component re-usabality. Refactor the Mat-Card
   into your own component. It must retain the same details.

2. Filter Fix: The application does not respect the currently chosen filter.
   Apply changes so the data is brought back correctly.

3. Order By: Currently there is not a way to order the data brought back.
  Implement a way to order the cards, by the first appearance in the show and another of your choosing.

Step 3 - Upload Project
